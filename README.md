# Rat In A Maze Visualizer

## Overview
The **Rat In A Maze Visualizer** is an interactive web application developed using React that visualizes the solution to the classic maze problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Users can generate different maze configurations and observe how the algorithm navigates through the maze to find a path from the starting point to the destination.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** Users can interact with the maze by adding barriers and altering its dimensions.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Watch the BFS algorithm in action as it explores the maze and finds the solution.
- **Customizable Settings:** Change the maze size and adjust the speed of the algorithm to suit your preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization:** Breath First Search Algo

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Huge1729/Rat_In_A_Maze_Visualizer.git
   cd Rat_In_A_Maze_Visualizer
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
### Running the Application
- To start the development server, run:
  ```bash
  npm start
- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application
### Usage
Once the application is running, you can:

- Generate a new maze by clicking the "Generate Maze" button.
- Add barriers by clicking on the grid cells.
- Click "Start" to visualize the BFS algorithm finding the path through the maze.
### Acknowledgements
- Inspired by classic algorithms and their visualizations.
- Special thanks to the React community for the support and resources.
